# Support

Welcome to the IML support documentation. The purpose of this site is to provide developers with
a resource of information that can be used to help resolve support issues. The issues and solutions we encounter 
as well as the level of difficulty vary between different versions of IML. When providing support to customer
tickets we should be diligent in logging a detailed explanation of the problem as well as the solution so that 
when the problem is encountered again in the future, the developer assigned to the issue will be able to quickly
analyze the problem and provide a solution. 

In addition to acting as a resource for troubleshooting support issues, this site will also include various useful developer
techniques. We believe in being a cross-functional team and thus should provide the knowledge on how to perform certain 
tasks within different parts of the application.
