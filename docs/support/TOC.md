* [Out of Sync OST's](out-of-sync-osts.md)

name that already exists. Learn how to reset the OST count index.
* [Volumes Not Displaying Properly](volumes-not-displaying-properly.md)

  resolve it so that all volumes are reflected correctly.
* [(Force) Lowering an Alert](lower-alert.md)

* [Cannot Add OST](cannot-add-osts.md)
